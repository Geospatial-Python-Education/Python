# Advanced Synoptic

### I've been student teaching MSU Denver's Advanced Synoptic Lab, so I was tasked to find some cool case study images to add to lecture notes.

The first example I tried to assemble was the end of January 2019 polar vortex that brought historic cold temperatures for the midwest US.
* Unfortunately the GFS archive grib files stop at Jan. 29th, right as the polar air is dropping into the midwest, so it's a little incomplete and very frustrating. https://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov/data/gfsanl/201901/

#### The data format for the archived data is grib

# Atmospheric Thermodynamics

### We were introducing isentropic analysis and the other LA and I wanted to have the students figure out which location correspnded to the the unnamed soundings based off up/down the hill technique.
