The purpose here was really just combating boredom and trying to learn new things in Python. 

The game simulates "bombs" being randomly dropped in the US and seeing if any hit in Colorado, and if they did were they close to where I lived.
The cool part I was able to integrate was if it hit anywhere in CO, a new Google Maps webpage would pop up with that location!
