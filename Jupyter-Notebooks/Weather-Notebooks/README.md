Sometimes the notebooks aren't showing in GitHub so here are some links via https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/:

## Some MetPy example plots with a bit of my own customization:

## Sample of an image saved from a website, WPC 4-day surface analysis forecast. I was able to make a four panel plot to put them all in one image:

## My final effort to plot GOES images:

## Comparing RAP Forecast and NWS Current Radar
* Finally got a chance to plot both forecast and actual Radar data to be able to compare the two plots.

### RAP Simulated

### GOES Visible Image with Meteogram
* This combo was to help show the possible deformation zone effect over ASOS stations (Cloud height shown)

## NEXRAD Level 2 Radar 
* From AWS NEXRAD Bucket
 - Having issues getting the data to plot in map projections in Catopy

## Plotting SPC Tornado Reports along with CWA 
* I was able to plot the reports by time based on a colormap so one can distinguish locations of tornadoes by color
