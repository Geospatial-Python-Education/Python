I would like to organize my Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for easy use:
* Make Jupyter notebooks that are workbooks - I can change and modify
* Make Jupyter notebooks that are to be run quickly for 3-day forecasts
* Turn the 3-day forecasts into Python scripts that can be run quickly in the terminal??


#### THREDDS server has recently updated their format so I proably need to go through my notebooks and change the code to register these new updates

### Finish High/Low:
*
