# Pandas are another flexible and easy to use package that will allow exploration and manipulation of data, as well as an interface into Python for plotting and other usage.

Pandas work in DataFrames

<i>Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively called index. Pandas Series is nothing but a column in an excel sheet.
Labels need not be unique but must be a hashable type. The object supports both integer and label-based indexing and provides a host of methods for performing operations involving the index.</i>
