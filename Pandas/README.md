<i>Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively called index. <b>Pandas Series is nothing but a column in an excel sheet.</b>
Labels need not be unique but must be a hashable type. <p style="text-decoration: underline;">The object supports both integer and label-based indexing.</p> and provides a host of methods for performing operations involving the index.</i>
