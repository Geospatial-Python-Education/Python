Documenting Python classes
---

Since the majority of my Python experience has been to gain working knowledge, mostly for plotting and data analysis, I have often overlooked the use of classes. I aim to change that and take a step towards becoming a true Python developer, and understanding classes has to be a major point along that journey.

Classes in Python are fairly basic and similar to classes in other languages. I have to admit when I first started learning classes it got a bit overwhelming. Since I really used Python as a data and science language for working with atmospheric science and mostly in Jupyter notebooks, I brute forced everything. I'm hoping to reconsider some projects in the eyes of classes.

One description of classes that helped me move beyond the abstract terminology was to consider classes like a questionnaire. The questionnaire (class) defines needed info and is just an idea until someone fills out the form. After filling out the form, an idea has become a thing. In Python terms, the class has been instantiated and the user's filled form is an instance of the class with actual information relevant to the user.

## Objects

All <em>classes</em> create <em>objects</em> and all objects therefore contain characteristics known as <em>attributes</em>.
