Grabbing Radar Data from Unidata's THREDDS Server

* This server has roughly a month'd worth of current data

---

I've put together a class fo functions that is meant to be a quick plotting script using ```siphon``` to access the THREDDS server
 
 ---

Here is an example of running it in a Jupyter notebook:

* The name of the script is Thredds_Lev3_Radar.py
```python
import Thredds_Lev3_Radar as radar
radar.example()
```
